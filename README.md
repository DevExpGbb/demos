| Foundry Agent OpenAI Compatibility Adapter | This adapter provides an OpenAI-compatible API layer for Azure AI Foundry Agents, allowing you to use existing OpenAI client libraries and tools with Azure AI Foundry Agents seamlessly. It acts as a bridge between the OpenAI API format and Azure AI Foundry Agent APIs. Moreover, this is a more elegant way to use AI Foundry Agent than using mcp integration. | [@satomic](https://github.com/satomic) | https://github.com/satomic/foundry-agent-openai-compat-adapter |
